          On the sandy bank under the trees the leaves lie deep and so crisp that a lizard makes a great skittering if
          he runs among them. Rabbits come out of the brush to sit on the sand in the evening, and the damp flats are
          covered with the night <a href="">tracks of &lsquo;coons</a>, and with the spread pads of dogs from the
          ranches, and with the split-wedge <strong>tracks of deer</strong> that come to drink in the dark.
